                            Distributed Systems Final Project
                            =================================

The goal of the final project is to produce a distributed software system that 
demonstrates what you have learned in this class and provides a useful service.
The focus of your project should be on the distributed aspects and correctness 
of the system and not the graphical, GUI, or other peripheral issues.

General Requirements
--------------------
- Efficient use of messages - Don't send messages unnecessarily.

- A detailed description of the algorithm and the system design should be
  provided. The initial design should be in the first design document.
  The final report should include an enhanced and updated design document.

- A system that produces correct results for all inputs. 

- An organized Makefile is required.

Delivery Date
-------------
Initial design document is due Thursday Nov 10 before class. 
Final delivery date is Friday December 9, noon. 


============================================================
Project description: Fault-tolerant distributed mail service
============================================================

Construct a reliable and efficient mail service for users over a 
network of computers. The service will comprise a mail server and
a mail client programs.

The service:
------------
Every user can connect via a mail client to any one of the replicated servers. 

The mail service provides the following capabilities; each capability
is one option of a client program's top level menu:

1. Login with a user name. Example: "u Tom". 
   The user needs to login with a user name to perform any of the tasks below.
   You should allow the user to login with a different name as part of the 
   menu at any time, by specifying the new user name in this option ("u Yair").

2. Connecting to a specific mail server. Example: "c 3" will connect to server 3.
   The client needs to connect to a mail server to perform any of the tasks below.

   You should allow the client program to change its mail server as
   part of the menu, by specifying the mail server's index. 

   * At any point, the client program may be connected to one mail server only.
   * To connect to a mail server, all a client needs to do is to set this
     mail server as its serving server. Client/Server communication should
     be done using Spread via the client's private group, and a public group
     with only that mail server in it (used by connected client programs to send
     messages to that mail server).

3. List the headers of received mail (The service should distinguish between 
   mail messages that were already read, and unread mail messages): "l"
   Result: 
	The result should display the user name, the responding mail server index and 
	a list of messages. The messages in the list will be numbered (1, 2, 3, ...) 
    and the sender and subject of each message will be displayed.

	* Each request for a list should result in the most up to date information 
	  that is possible.

4. Mail a message to a user: "m"
   	to:  <user name>
        subject:  <subject string>
        <msg string>           

          * 'to' and 'subject' are fields that should be added
            as part of the header, as in the Unix mail service.
            Note that the size of the msg string can be bounded to 1000 bytes.

5. Delete a mail message (read or unread): Example "d 10" will delete the
   10th message in the current list of messages.

6. Read a received mail message (read or unread): Example "r 5" will display
   the content of the 5th message in the current list of messages. 
   The message should be marked as read thereafter.

7. Print the membership (identities) of the mail servers in the current mail server's 
   network component. Example "v".


The mail servers:
-----------------

A mail client connects to one of the mail server processes.

Each of the mail server processes is a daemon that runs "forever". The mail server 
may crash and may subsequently recover. The network between the mail servers may 
partition and re-merge. The overall set of mail servers is fixed - there are 
exactly five mail servers, each running on a different ugrad machine.

The mail server is started with its id as a parameter:
	$ ./server [1-5]

The client programs must always receive a consistent view of their mail, 
regardless of which mail server is consulted (of course, as consistent  
as possible, according to the network connectivity). Multiple client programs can be
logged in as the same user at the same time.

The list of mail messages should be consistent as to which messages have been 
received, read or deleted. Each mail server should save information separately 
on disk. Note that mail servers can be eventually consistent even if they are never 
directly connected (think about eventual path propagation). 

If mail is sent, read, or deleted, possibly in different network partitions, the 
resulting mailbox should appear in a consistent manner, once the partition is healed 
(as much as possible based on network connectivity).


The membership emulation:
-------------------------
The membership emulation will be managed by spmonitor, an interactive program 
provided with the Spread toolkit. spmonitor can redefine the membership configuration 
at any time by defining for each Spread daemon which network component it 
belongs to, or defining some daemons as crashed. Note that spmonitor will generate 
Spread daemon partitions and crashes, but your program should also handle 
user-induced crashes (Ctrl+C) of the Spread daemons, mail servers, and mail clients.  

When a Spread daemon crashes, the mail server attached to it has to crash (exit) 
also. A crashed mail server exits the program immediately! It is not allowed to 
write to disk after a mail server loses its connection to Spread!

When a mail server crashes, clients connected to that mail server will report the 
loss of connection to the user, so that the user can connect to another mail server 
and continue mailing/receiving messages. 

Important note:  The users are not known beforehand, and their number is not bounded.

CS 600.337 students can assume that no mail server or Spread daemon crashes ever. 
They only need to handle network partitions and merges. Therefore, they do not 
need to write to or read from disk. This also simplifies the rest of the project.
