-if receive update (read, delete) for email that we don't have yet we put an empty node
where the email should be with null data (so that we don't print it) and then when we
get the email we can just fill the data in the null node
-server shouldn't be doing any printing; sends information to client and client prints the information
-can we attach the updates array to each update? 
-when we update the 2d arrays after a merge every server sends its own 2d array to every other process. To process this matrix, when we receive it
we compare each cell with our own matrix and set the larger of the two values to our own (check that this is actually okay to do)??
